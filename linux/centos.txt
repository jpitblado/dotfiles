Notes for CentOS 7:

Get and set the size of the mouse pointer:

	$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size
	24

	$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size 48

Make Gnome 3 workspaces work on both monditors in a dual-monitor setup:


	$ gsettings get org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary
	true

	$ gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false

	However, this did not seem to work.  I then noticed that the
	Gnome-Tweak-Tool has a 'Workspaces' tab, and found an on/off
	toggle for 'Workspaces only on primary dispplay'.  I turned it
	off, and now have the behavior that I wanted.
