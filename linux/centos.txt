Notes for CentOS 7:

Get and set the size of the mouse pointer:

	$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size
	24

	$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size 48

Make Gnome 3 workspaces work on both monditors in a dual-monitor setup:


	$ gsettings get org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary
	true

	$ gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false

	However, this did not seem to work.  I then noticed that the
	Gnome-Tweak-Tool has a 'Workspaces' tab, and found an on/off
	toggle for 'Workspaces only on primary dispplay'.  I turned it
	off, and now have the behavior that I wanted.

Setup the apache web server:

	Install the server:

		$ sudo yum install httpd

	Edit 'DocumentRoot' in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	Enable 'UserDir' in /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf

	Turn on the service:

		$ sudo systemctl enable httpd.service

	To start/stop/restart the server:

		$ sudo apachectl start
		$ sudo apachectl stop
		$ sudo apachectl restart

<end>
